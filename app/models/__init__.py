# Optional: Define cross-model relationships here if needed
# This is usually already handled inside individual model files,
# but if you're adding dynamically, it can go here.

# Example: If Blog.author is ForeignKey('users.id'), and not already set up:
# User.blogs = db.relationship('Blog', backref='author_blogs', lazy=True)
# But this is NOT needed if you have this in `blog.py` already
